Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats (e.g., size and installs).

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed categories, ratings, and installs using visualizations to identify trends.

Found top-performing apps and categories.

# Feature Engineering:

Converted text-based features like Installs and Price into numerical values.
